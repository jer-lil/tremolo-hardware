This is the hardware (PCB, MCAD) design for a tremolo pedal for guitar (or bass, synth, tonewheel organ, whatever you like). 
The firmware is here: https://github.com/jer-lil/tremolo-firmware/tree/main

This tremolo packs a lot of features into a very small (Hammond 125B, 65x120mm) enclosure.
Features include:

- All analog signal path
- Full stereo, with dedicated 1/4" jacks
- Harmonic tremolo
  - Continually adjustable LFO phase, allowing for sounds between mono/stereo/harmonic not found in other tremolo pedals (that I've discovered, please let me know if you know of any)
- Envelope control
  - The louder you play, the faster the tremolo goes. Or slower. Or stronger. Or the triangle wave warps towards a sawtooth. You decide.
- Expression pedal control
- Tap Tempo
  - Optional external tap signal
- "Ramp" mode, allowing user to ramp the rate up or down using a footswitch
- MIDI control

Note that at the time of writing, this project is still in progress.
As such, I have not been focusing on public documentation. If you have questions, please reach out.
